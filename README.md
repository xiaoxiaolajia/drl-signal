# drl-signal
a deep reinforcement learning algorithm(dqn) for traffic signal control

The code files are modified from: https://github.com/Pi-Star-Lab/RESCO. We get better global efficiency by introduce the concept "pressure" into the reward function. Besides, 
considering the performance of a single intersection, we user waiting time difference. 
For more detailed usage and guide, you can refer to https://github.com/Pi-Star-Lab/RESCO.
